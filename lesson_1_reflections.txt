How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	You can easly find changing parts. It make finding the cause of 
	bug	much easyre.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By entire file history you can see the privious ways of thothts.
    And sometimes go away to the privious version to make this path 
    of changing more clearly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: flexibility
    Minus: you need to save all changes yourselfe and can't forget to do it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think, it's because in git you mostly save interdependent files,
    while in smth like Google Docs you save independent ones.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: I can see changes in common declarativity way
    git diff: I can see changes in more detailing level

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always recover files

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I wanna use Git in my own web-application
